# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Project Overview
The Real Estate Price Prediction project aims to predict property prices based on various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. This project uses machine learning techniques to build a predictive model and provides a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for backend development.
- **Numpy & Pandas**: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**: Model building and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development and experimentation.
- **Visual Studio Code & PyCharm**: IDEs for coding and debugging.
- **Python Flask**: HTTP server for serving the web application.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for creating the user interface.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Utilizes Numpy and Pandas to clean and preprocess the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Employs Matplotlib to visualize key data trends and insights.
- **Model Building**: Implements machine learning models using Scikit-learn to predict real estate prices.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a web-based interface for users to input property details and receive price estimates.
- **Flask Integration**: Uses Flask to handle HTTP requests and serve the web application.
